## Styling issues

1. 
    - Issue 1: When inserting a icon in my base file, this was not visible on my screen. I opened the console and I saw some error messages.  
    ![fontawesome error](fontawesomeerror.png)  
    
    - Solution: This issue got resolved by adding my personal fontawesome kit to the base file. 

2. 
    - Issue 2: CSS file not loading
    - Solution: I forgot to add the static files dir to the settings. Adding this to the setting solved the error 404 not found.
